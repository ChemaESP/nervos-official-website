CKB-VM has zero precompiles baked in and supports all cryptographic primitives, meaning developers can build powerful decentralized applications that aren't possible elsewhere.`

      <>
        CKB is among the few smart contract platforms that leverage the battle-tested Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm
        to ensure exceptional security and decentralization under all circumstances. This makes CKB truly permissionless
        and uniquely resistant to capture by hostile actors--precisely what a Layer 1 built for modularity should be.

    content: (
      <>
        CKB uses the NC-Max consensus mechanism, a variant of Bitcoin&apos;s Nakamoto Consensus (NC). While retaining
        all of NC&apos;s advantages, NC-Max improves the performance limit and resistance to selfish mining attacks by
        adopting a two-step confirmation process. NC-Max increases transaction throughput and decreases confirmation
        times. The network can handle around 100 to 200 transactions per second but also can increase its capacity as
        bandwidth and latency improve over time. Read the <a>NC-max paper </a>ðŸ¡­ and this <a>article</a>, and watch this{' '}
        <a>video</a>

        CKB uses a novel, simple hash function called the Eaglesong that lowers the barrier for ASIC manufacturing.
        CKB&apos;s design is ASIC neutral, and the first ASIC was released four months after the mainnet launch. To
        learn more, read our mining guide ðŸ¡­ and the pages dedicated to mining rigs ðŸ¡­ and mining pools.
